## Lourens
- p.6: here you use no subscript for conditional independence and the subscript G for d-separation in the graph. But later this is not always consistent. Maybe just check for inconsistency

- Table1 assumptions: independent errors are not necessary for FCI. Whenever errors are dependent, there is an equivalent model to the independent error case, using a latent variable that explains the correlations among the error terms. This is described in Spirtes (1994)

- on page 13 you discuss in step 3 the conditions to obtain B <- C. I think one condition is missing, which you discuss after (see pdf).


## EJ

- rename "others" folder & clarify (maybe just take each folder out and have them independently: presentation, research report, etc..).

- a separate README for the supp.material --> attach the link for the html file.

- check all the scripts if they run according to the restructured folders and renamed files.

- Add the description for the folders/files : make sure it is clear how to reproduce the study results.

- (don't forget to mention the seed?)

- make the repo public and get the doi for the repo --> correct the citation


## Check with Oisin

- alpha level reference
- Figures x-axis labels
- Appendices...(CCD Appendix A is not actually mentioned in the main text)
- algorithm running time in appendix?

## To-dos
- Readme add description table and clean up
- Code annotate properly
- Seed.. explain what? ask Rens
- Make defense slides
-
