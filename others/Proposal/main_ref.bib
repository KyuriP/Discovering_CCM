	abstract = {Previous asymptotically correct algorithms for recovering causal structure from sample probabilities have been limited even in sparse causal graphs to a few variables. We describe an asymptotically correct algorithm whose complexity for fixed graph connectivity increases polynomially in the number of vertices, and may in practice recover sparse graphs with several hundred variables. From sample data with n = 20,000, an implementation of the algorithm on a DECStation 3100 recovers the edges in a linear version of the ALARM network with 37 vertices and 46 edges. Fewer than 8\% of the undirected edges are incorrectly identified in the output. Without prior ordering information, the program also determines the direction of edges for the ALARM graph with an error rate of 14\%. Processing time is less than 10 seconds.

	abstract = {Causal processes in nature may contain cycles, and real datasets may violate causal sufficiency as well as contain selection bias. No constraint-based causal discovery algorithm can currently handle cycles, latent variables and selection bias (CLS) simultaneously. I therefore introduce an algorithm called cyclic causal inference (CCI) that makes sound inferences with a conditional independence oracle under CLS, provided that we can represent the cyclic causal process as a non-recursive linear structural equation model with independent errors. Empirical results show that CCI outperforms the cyclic causal discovery algorithm in the cyclic case as well as rivals the fast causal inference and really fast causal inference algorithms in the acyclic case. An R implementation is available at https://github.com/ericstrobl/CCI.},
