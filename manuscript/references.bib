It emphasizes nonparametric methods which can really only be implemented with modern computing power on large and complex data sets.

@incollection{bollen_eight_2013,
	abstract = {Causality was at the center of the early history of structural equation models (SEMs) which continue to serve as the most popular approach to causal analysis in the social sciences. Through decades of development, critics and defenses of the capability of SEMs to support causal inference have accumulated. A variety of misunderstandings and myths about the nature of SEMs and their role in causal analysis have emerged, and their repetition has led some to believe they are true. Our chapter is organized by presenting eight myths about causality and SEMs in the hope that this will lead to a more accurate understanding. More specifically, the eight myths are the following: (1) SEMs aim to establish causal relations from associations alone, (2) SEMs and regression are essentially equivalent, (3) no causation without manipulation, (4) SEMs are not equipped to handle nonlinear causal relationships, (5) a potential outcome framework is more principled than SEMs, (6) SEMs are not applicable to experiments with randomized treatments, (7) mediation analysis in SEMs is inherently noncausal, and (8) SEMs do not test any major part of the theory against the data. We present the facts that dispel these myths, describe what SEMs can and cannot do, and briefly present our critique of current practice using SEMs. We conclude that the current capabilities of SEMs to formalize and implement causal inference tasks are indispensible; its potential to do more is even greater.},

@article{briganti_tutorial_2022,
	abstract = {Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent conditional independence relationships among variables as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges can be interpreted as causal effects connecting one causal symptom to an effect symptom. These models can help overcome one of the key limitations of partial correlation networks whose edges are undirected. This tutorial aims to introduce Bayesian Networks to identify admissible causal relationships in cross-sectional data, as well as how to estimate these models in R through three algorithm families with an empirical example data set of depressive symptoms. In addition, we discuss common problems and questions related to Bayesian networks. We recommend Bayesian networks be investigated to gain causal insight in psychological data.

The present review frames the notion of anhedonia as reduced ability to experience pleasure and diminished sensitivity to rewarding stimuli such as palatable food or social interaction within the context of appetite dysregulation in depression, addressing the main neural networks involved in the alteration of brain reward processing. This circuit-based framework focuses on selected brain regions such as lateral hypothalamus, ventral pallidum, lateral habenula and mesocorticolimbic target areas such as nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. The examination in particular of the role of dopamine, orexin and GABAergic neurotransmission is complemented by the exploration of the endocannabinoid signaling as homeostatic, anti-stress system and its relevance in depression pathophysiology and anhedonia symptoms.},

Three hundred and sixty-three chronic pain patients were divided into two groups based on how much they expressed difficulty in concentrating and remembering things. Each patient was given a physical examination and completed a pain evaluation questionnaire and an SCL-90. Physician ratings of the patients' depression and anxiety were also obtained. The results showed that problems in concentration and memory were related to emotional distress, poor family support, and interference with daily activities. It is suggested that techniques to improve concentration and memory should be incorporated as part of a multidisciplinary pain program.},

We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula--or "nonparanormal"--for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method's theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples.},

@article{magliacane_ancestral_2017,
	abstract = {Constraint-based causal discovery from limited data is a notoriously difficult challenge due to the many borderline independence test decisions. Several approaches to improve the reliability of the predictions by exploiting redundancy in the independence information have been proposed recently. Though promising, existing approaches can still be greatly improved in terms of accuracy and scalability. We present a novel method that reduces the combinatorial explosion of the search space by using a more coarse-grained representation of causal information, drastically reducing computation time. Additionally, we propose a method to score causal predictions based on their confidence. Crucially, our implementation also allows one to easily combine observational and interventional data and to incorporate various types of available background knowledge. We prove soundness and asymptotic consistency of our method and demonstrate that it can outperform the state-of-the-art on synthetic data, achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We illustrate its practical feasibility by applying it on a challenging protein data set.},

The theory unifies the graphical, potential-outcome (Neyman-Rubin), decision analytical, and structural equation approaches to causation, and provides both a mathematical foundation and a friendly calculus for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper establishes a methodology for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) the answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effect of potential interventions, (2) queries about counterfactuals, and (3) queries about the direct (or indirect) effect of one event on another.},

@book{pearl_probabilistic_1988,
	abstract = {Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete and accessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty--and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition--in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.},

@article{peters_causal_2016,
	abstract = {What is the difference between a prediction that is made with a causal model and that with a non-causal model? Suppose that we intervene on the predictor variables or change the whole environment. The predictions from a causal model will in general work as well under interventions as for observational data. In contrast, predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (e.g. various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including large-scale gene perturbation experiments.},
