	abstract = {Linear regression and its variants like analysis of variance are arguably the most widely used statistical techniques in psychology. By using linear regression it is merely assumed rather than empirically tested that the effects of the predictor variables are linear and homogeneous across the distribution of the dependent variable. This is problematic because it biases a scientist's reasoning and hinders possible practical and theoretical insights. Thus an important question to ask is: Are the effects studied by psychologists really linear and homogeneous? Generalized additive models (GAMs) and quantile regression can be used to pursue this question. Benefits of complementing linear regression with these approaches include the ability to tailor actions on the specific individual in practice and the opportunity to gain more advanced scientific knowledge, for example about non-linear effects. The use of GAMs and quantile regression is furthermore empirically demonstrated in an analysis of risk-seeking and criminal peer networks as predictors of violent crime in a representative sample of German youth (N = 44.610). Practical and theoretical consequences of the results are discussed. Psychological science could immensely benefit from studying non-linear and heterogeneous effects.},

@incollection{bollen_eight_2013,
	abstract = {Causality was at the center of the early history of structural equation models (SEMs) which continue to serve as the most popular approach to causal analysis in the social sciences. Through decades of development, critics and defenses of the capability of SEMs to support causal inference have accumulated. A variety of misunderstandings and myths about the nature of SEMs and their role in causal analysis have emerged, and their repetition has led some to believe they are true. Our chapter is organized by presenting eight myths about causality and SEMs in the hope that this will lead to a more accurate understanding. More specifically, the eight myths are the following: (1) SEMs aim to establish causal relations from associations alone, (2) SEMs and regression are essentially equivalent, (3) no causation without manipulation, (4) SEMs are not equipped to handle nonlinear causal relationships, (5) a potential outcome framework is more principled than SEMs, (6) SEMs are not applicable to experiments with randomized treatments, (7) mediation analysis in SEMs is inherently noncausal, and (8) SEMs do not test any major part of the theory against the data. We present the facts that dispel these myths, describe what SEMs can and cannot do, and briefly present our critique of current practice using SEMs. We conclude that the current capabilities of SEMs to formalize and implement causal inference tasks are indispensible; its potential to do more is even greater.},

@article{borsboom_network_2017,
	abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

@article{briganti_tutorial_2022,
	abstract = {Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent conditional independence relationships among variables as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges can be interpreted as causal effects connecting one causal symptom to an effect symptom. These models can help overcome one of the key limitations of partial correlation networks whose edges are undirected. This tutorial aims to introduce Bayesian Networks to identify admissible causal relationships in cross-sectional data, as well as how to estimate these models in R through three algorithm families with an empirical example data set of depressive symptoms. In addition, we discuss common problems and questions related to Bayesian networks. We recommend Bayesian networks be investigated to gain causal insight in psychological data.

@misc{canonne_testing_2018,
	abstract = {We study the problem of testing {\textbackslash}emph\{conditional independence\} for discrete distributions. Specifically, given samples from a discrete random variable \$(X, Y, Z)\$ on domain \$[{\textbackslash}ell\_1]{\textbackslash}times[{\textbackslash}ell\_2] {\textbackslash}times [n]\$, we want to distinguish, with probability at least \$2/3\$, between the case that \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are conditionally independent given \$Z\$ from the case that \$(X, Y, Z)\$ is \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-far, in \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-distance, from every distribution that has this property. Conditional independence is a concept of central importance in probability and statistics with a range of applications in various scientific domains. As such, the statistical task of testing conditional independence has been extensively studied in various forms within the statistics and econometrics communities for nearly a century. Perhaps surprisingly, this problem has not been previously considered in the framework of distribution property testing and in particular no tester with sublinear sample complexity is known, even for the important special case that the domains of \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are binary. The main algorithmic result of this work is the first conditional independence tester with \{{\textbackslash}em sublinear\} sample complexity for discrete distributions over \$[{\textbackslash}ell\_1]{\textbackslash}times[{\textbackslash}ell\_2] {\textbackslash}times [n]\$. To complement our upper bounds, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds establishing that the sample complexity of our algorithm is optimal, up to constant factors, for a number of settings. Specifically, for the prototypical setting when \${\textbackslash}ell\_1, {\textbackslash}ell\_2 = O(1)\$, we show that the sample complexity of testing conditional independence (upper bound and matching lower bound) is {\textbackslash}[ {\textbackslash}Theta{\textbackslash}left(\{{\textbackslash}max{\textbackslash}left(n{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2,{\textbackslash}min{\textbackslash}left(n{\textasciicircum}\{7/8\}/{\textbackslash}epsilon,n{\textasciicircum}\{6/7\}/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{8/7\}{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}right)\}{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash},. {\textbackslash}]},

	abstract = {Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula--or "nonparanormal"--for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method's theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews a theory of causal inference based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a). The theory unifies the graphical, potential-outcome (Neyman-Rubin), decision analytical, and structural equation approaches to causation, and provides both a mathematical foundation and a friendly calculus for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper establishes a methodology for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) the answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effect of potential interventions, (2) queries about counterfactuals, and (3) queries about the direct (or indirect) effect of one event on another.},
