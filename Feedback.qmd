- p.6: here you use no subscript for conditional independence and the subscript G for d-separation in the graph. But later this is not always consistent. Maybe just check for inconsistency

- Table1 assumptions: independent errors are not necessary for FCI. Whenever errors are dependent, there is an equivalent model to the independent error case, using a latent variable that explains the correlations among the error terms. This is described in Spirtes (1994)


- on page 13 you discuss in step 3 the conditions to obtain B <- C. I think one condition is missing, which you discuss after (see pdf).
